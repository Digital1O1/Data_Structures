## Complexities

### Two types
- Time complexity : Amount of TIME required to execute the code
- Space complexity : Amount of SPACE required to execute the functionalities of the code
- Auxiliary Space : Extra space used in the program other than input data structure

### Both time/space complexities are measured with respects to the input parameters  
#### Issue : Time required to execute code dependes on several factors such as :
- Number of operations performed in program
- Speed of device 
- Data transfer speed if being executed on an online platform
  
### How to determine which one is efficient --> Asymptotic notation
- Mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. 
  - Neglects system-depdendent constants
  - Related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program
  
### Three asymptotic notation used to represent the time complexity of algorithms

## Big-O (O) 
  - Describes the worst-case scenario 
  - Most commonly used
    - Gives upper bound of the running time of the code 
    - Or the amount of memory used in terms of input size
## Omega Notation (Ω)
  - Describes best-case scenario
## Theta Notation (θ) 
  - Represents average complexity of an algorithm
