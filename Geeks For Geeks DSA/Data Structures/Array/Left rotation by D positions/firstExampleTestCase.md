### Given array: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

### Rotation distance (rotationDistance) = 2

### Array size = 7

### GCD(2, 7) = 1 (We'll have only one set)

| Iteration | Temp | i | j=0 | j=2 | j=4 | j=6 | rotationDistance | g_c_d | k |
|-----------|------|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|---|-------|---|
| Initial   |      |   | 1   | 3   | 5   | 7   |   |       |   |
| 1st       | 1    | 0 | 2   | 3   | 5   | 7   | 2 | 1     | 2 |
| 2nd       | 1    | 1 | 2   | 4   | 5   | 7   | 2 | 1     | 4 |
| 3rd       | 1    | 2 | 2   | 4   | 6   | 7   | 2 | 1     | 6 |
| 4th       | 1    | 3 | 2   | 4   | 6   | 3   | 2 | 1     | 8 |



### Final rotated array: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}

## Explanation:

In each iteration of the loop, the value at index j is moved to j + rotationDistance. 

If j + rotationDistance exceeds the array size, it wraps around to the beginning of the array (using modulo operation).

The process continues until k (the new index) becomes equal to i (the starting index of the set). 

This indicates that the current set has been rotated completely.

The process repeats for each set until all sets have been rotated. 

In this case, there's only one set because GCD(2, 7) = 1.
